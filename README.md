<h3>About</h3>
This was my final demonstration project in vocational school (Vamia). I was curious if I would be able to simulate simple evolution from scratch. You can find the documentation (in Finnish) from the root directory.

<h3>How to test it?</h3>
This is included in the documentation, but if you're not Finnish, just ask me!
